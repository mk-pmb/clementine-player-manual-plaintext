SYNOPSIS
    clementine [options] [URL(s)]

DESCRIPTION
    This text file briefly documents the clementine commands.

    This text file is based on the debian manual page because no plain text
    version of it was available. The debian manual page was written for the
    Debian distribution because the original program does not have one.

    Clementine is a modern music player and library organizer.
    It is inspired by Amarok 1.4 and is written to take advantage of Qt4.

      • Edit tags on MP3 and OGG files, organise your music.
      • Download missing album cover art from Last.fm.
      • Cross-platform - works on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
      • Native desktop notifications on Linux (libnotify) and Mac OS X (Growl).
